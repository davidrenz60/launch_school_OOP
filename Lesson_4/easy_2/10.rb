# What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.


# Not exposing methods to other parts of code that doesn't need it. Reduce namespace issues

# Inheritence and modules: allows to give functionality to other parts without rewriting code

# Custom objects allow to break down a problem into nouns and verbs

# Faster development

# overriding methods and using fake operators to extend functionality to created objects
